Use the nvram command to manipulate variables

- bootArgs:

“-FileNVRAMng” disable random-gen the ROM/MLB values.

“-FileNVRAMro” makes FileNVRAM.kext to be read only. This allow external scripts/Applications to dump the nvram to a custom place (e.g. in the ESP).

“-EnableLogging” enable the debug log of FileNVRAM.kext, disabled by default.

“-NoFileNVRAM” cause the FileNVRAM to do nothing by returning false inside its start() method.
